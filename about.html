        <li>Run workshops: group learning periods where students can lead and learn both CS and other maker skills.</li>
        <li>Create projects: anything a student wants to make, be it an app, a tool, an event, we want to make it happen as a team.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are students from across Queens and NYC who are working together to create meaningful work for our school and the pipeline to continue doing it.</p>
