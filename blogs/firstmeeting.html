                <h3>Our First Meeting and Workshop</h3>
                <p>So in case you have not heard, our Hack Club had its first meeting. It was an exciting tuesday for sure.</p>
                <p>Here's what you need to know in case you missed out</p>
                <p>We invited members in, talked about what hack club(code club) is, our mission, and what workshops will look like.</p>
                <p>We also asked everyone to fill out the join form on this website and the attendance form for clubs, which is in the google classroom and necessary for recording your time in the building after hours.</p>
                <p>We then moved onto the Machine Learning workshop with Google's teachable machine.</p>
                <p>We at the end of the hour had quite a few ML models that ranged from a ball detector to a finger detector. Yeah... You had to be there.</p>
                <p>We also had some news. Our next meeting is October 4, a Tuesday, at 2:30PM</p>
                <p>Everyone is welcome to Hack Club! Join us then for a personal website workshop.</p>
